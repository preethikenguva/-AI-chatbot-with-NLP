problem statement: 

This project demonstrates a simple rule-based chatbot built using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP) with NLTK. The chatbot can engage in basic conversations and respond to user queries with predefined answers.

## ðŸ“ŒObjective

To create an interactive chatbot using NLP techniques capable of understanding and responding to simple text-based user queries.

## ðŸ§° Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python** â€“ Core programming language
- **NLTK** â€“ Natural Language Toolkit for basic NLP processing

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included

- `chatbot.py` â€“ Main Python script for running the chatbot
- `requirements.txt` â€“ Python dependencies
- `README.md` â€“ Project documentation

## ðŸš€ How to Run

ðŸ“Œ Summary
This project presents a simple AI-based chatbot built using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP) with the NLTK library. The chatbot is capable of understanding basic user inputs and responding with predefined answers using pattern matching. It demonstrates how rule-based NLP techniques can be used to create interactive and responsive conversational bots. The chatbot is easy to expand and can serve as a foundation for more advanced AI assistants by integrating machine learning, APIs, or multilingual support in future developments.
